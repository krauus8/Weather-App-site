# Weather-App-site
 Finished my very first fullstack website <br> 
 
 <strong>App link</strong> <h1>https://stark-beach-52439.herokuapp.com/</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>• when the app loads, it gets the IP address and uses the city name to show weather in that city,
  <p>• when you enter a city and add, it makes a new card below the form area.</p>
    • The added cities data is not dynamic but this is the first commit so I will make it dynamic as a learn, for the same reason that why you can put the same city many times
  
</p>
<h1>skills I used</h1>
<p>• Basic frontend skills and Backend dev </p>
<p>• Back end with node.js and npm with various packages like express, http, </p>
<p>• deploying webapp to heroku</p>

<p>I am looking forward to make the same app with React front end and nodejs backend  </p>

<h2>Add as many cities you can</h2>
