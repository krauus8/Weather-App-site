# Weather-App-site
 finished my very first website fullstack...though no database
 app link <h1>https://stark-beach-52439.herokuapp.com/</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>.when the app loads, it gets the IP address and uses the city name to show weather in that city,
    .when you enter a city and add, it makes a new card below the form area.
    .The added cities data is not dynamic but this is the first commit so I will make it dynamic as a learn, for the same reason that why you can put the same city many times
